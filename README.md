# Cranky Cranky
Cranky Cranky is a simulation of a generator that turns mechanical energy into electrical energy.

## Usage
Enter in values for the select variables (resistivity of wire, pole strength, number of coils in wire) or leave them as their default values. 

Choose whether you want the generator to have a split-ring commutator by checking/unchecking the respective box. If the box is unchecked, the generator will not have a split-ring commutator.

Input an angular velocity if you want the simulation to turn the handle of the generator at a constant speed, or uncheck the respective box to spin the handle manually by clicking it and dragging in a circular motion. 

## Physics
In this model, we are neglecting the torque that the magnetic force produces when a current begins to flow through the wire in the magnetic field. We also set some variables used in the calculations, such as the area of the loop, as constant.

The equation used to calculate the current generated by the user at a given time t is 
I(t) = (NBAw / R) * sin(wt), where:
N = number of coils in the wire
B = magnetic field, which is proportional to the pole strength
A = area enclosed by the loop of wire
w = angular velocity of the handle
R = resistance of the wire, which is proportional to the resistivity of the wire

From this, we can use Ohmâ€™s law for power to generate the equation for power.

The default settings in this program are;
Resistivity of wire = 1.72e-8 Ohm-meters (resistivity of copper wire)
Pole strength = 130 A * m
Number of coils in wire = 200
Split-ring commutator = yes
Angular velocity = 5 rads / s
Area enclosed = 0.08 m^2
