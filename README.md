Final Project for AP Physics C

## idea 2 - hand crank generator charges phone
- demo for mechanical energy -> electrical energy conversion
- generator will be connected to a phone which will charge proportionally to the amount of energy produced
- includes graphs to show the magnetic field in the generator, the emf, and the current produced
- phone can switch between different applications that consume more / less power
- goal will be to keep the phone running as long as possible while it cycles through different apps
